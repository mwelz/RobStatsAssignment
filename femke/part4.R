## Jakob Raymaekers Cauchy distribution

# Figure 8 in section 5.3 in [2] carries out a different experiment, where the power of
# the permutation test implemented in dcor.test is plotted as a function of the sample
# size n (left) and the dimension d (right).

# 2 degrees of freedom ----------------------------------------------------
## Analogue student t-distibutions 2 degrees of freedom
